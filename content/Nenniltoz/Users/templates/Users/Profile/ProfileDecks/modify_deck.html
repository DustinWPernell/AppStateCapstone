    Values needed for deck creation.
    After deck is created allow user to add cards.
    as a card is added call JS to auto add to database
    deck_name = duh
    is_private = checkbox checked is private. default will be based on user setting passed in with context
    image_url = open new page like with select avatar on profile
    description = large text area like on card display
    deck_type : will be id passed in with name in context
    commander : can be null


    When adding cards use JS on click to add to hidden field(name = "hid_deck_card_list")/session(name = "deck_card_list").
    Init value for hid will be passed in and will be equivalent to session
        Format = {{"card_id1": cards_id1, "quantity1": quantity1}{"card_id2": cards_id2, "quantity2": quantity2}}
    IF card in field, show text box with quantity (starts at 1 unless more cards in deck).
    If Quantity changed update in field(name = "hid_deck_card_list")/session(name = "deck_card_list") using JS
    Have "Save cards" button (name = "save_cards") that store cards in the deck.


    possibly use this method for adding card to list and add textboxes
